This website is a group project for 15-390. 

The course is meant to introduce us to the fundementals of Entrepreunership.
Our idea is to implement a way to give users the possibility to make their travel experience more authentic.

The website is still a prototype.
What we will implement next:
- Make the chatbox fully functional (We already have the code separetely, we just need to translate it to this project)
- Improve the design 
- Add a database (Make it dynamic)
